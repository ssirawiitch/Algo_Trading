    "## 🔍 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore a **rule-based trading strategy** driven by financial news sentiment. The goal is to identify market opportunities by analyzing whether positive or negative news impacts short-term stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to extract sentiment scores from financial news headlines and content. Based on sentiment thresholds, we generate buy/sell signals and evaluate the strategy using historical price data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines concepts from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\n",
    "- **Quantitative Trading**\n",
    "- **Backtesting & Strategy Evaluation**\n",

    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and preprocess financial news data with stock tickers and timestamps\n",
    "- Apply sentiment analysis using pre-trained models (TextBlob, VADER, or Transformers)\n",
    "- Design a simple rule-based trading strategy:\n",
    "    - **Long if sentiment > 0.9**\n",
    "    - **Avoid or short if sentiment < 0.1**\n",
    "- Backtest the strategy using daily price returns\n",
    "- Evaluate performance using:\n",
    "    - **Total Return**\n",
    "    - **Sharpe Ratio**\n",
    "    - **Max Drawdown**\n",
    "    - **Win Rate** (based on 1-day, 3-day, 5-day returns after the news)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation\n",
    "- `textblob`, `vaderSentiment`, or `transformers` for sentiment scoring\n",
    "- `yfinance` for historical price data\n",
    "- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization\n",
    "- Optional: `backtesting.py` or custom backtesting logic\n",

    "## 📌 Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified prototype model for educational purposes, developed as part of the **QuantCU Camp**. In real-world trading, more robust models and risk management techniques are required.\n",
